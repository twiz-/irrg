   process resize_to_fit: [1300, 620]

  # version :thumb do
  #   process :resize_to_fit => [50, 50]
  # end

  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_white_list
    %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
  end

  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
